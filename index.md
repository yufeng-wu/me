## About Me

I graduated from [Williams College](https://williams.edu/) in June, 2024 with a B.A. with Honors in Computer Science and Economics. 

My research mainly lies in the intersection of Machine Learning and Causal Inference. I wrote my undergraduate thesis in with Prof. [Rohit Bhattacharya](https://rohit-bhattacharya.com/) on developing novel causal inference methods in social networks where data is non-i.i.d.. My thesis can be accessed [here](https://librarysearch.williams.edu/discovery/delivery/01WIL_INST:01WIL_SPECIAL/12406122570002786).

## Research Interests

- **Responsible AI--Robustness, Safety, and Generalizability:** Investigating why models fail in certain scenarios and creating methods to develop models that perform reliably across diverse real-world contexts.

- **Causality for AI:** leveraging the framework of causality to enhance AI models' explainability, resilience to distribution shifts, and management of dependencies in the training data.
